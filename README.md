resume
======

This is my fork of [edunham's resume](https://github.com/edunham/resume).
For an excellent resume resource and some good LaTeX info head on over there.

The LaTeX code is licensed under the MIT license, to prevent any ambiguity
about the fact that you are welcome to copy it and use it for whatever
purposes you like. The intended purpose is to make your own resume pretty
without having to think very much about LaTeX.

See edunham's advice at http://lug.oregonstate.edu/blog/resume/ for other technical
resume tips.

How to use
----------

To generate and view the PDF, I run ``pdflatex resume.tex && evince
resume.pdf``. You can also use the included Makefile if you prefer.

Everything before the ``\begin{document}`` configures the style and
formatting.

Your document's appearance will rarely change when you mess with indentation
in the source, but will often change if you add or remove a blank line.

Job Search Links

* [We Work Remotely](https://weworkremotely.com/) has remote tech industry jobs
* [Europe Remotely](http://europeremotely.com/) weekly update on jobs for
  remoties in European time zones
* [whitetruffle](https://www.whitetruffle.com) seems to aggregate mostly
  smaller, startup-type tech opportunities
* [ziprecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/jobs) is an aggregator that
  covers categories outside of tech, but doesn't appear to have a very
  fine-grained search within categories
* [Hired](https://hired.com/signup) is a poorly-named but seemingly
  well-executed system wherein your profile goes in a marketplace for a week
  and companies sort of bid on you.
* [workintech.io](http://workintech.io/) aggregates a whole bunch of these by
  category, including diversity, geographic region, and internship
* [Hiring-Without-Whiteboards](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards)
